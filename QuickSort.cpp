   p is stay in one step away from pivot element
   if p is greate than  ans equal pivote element then stop
   if q is less than and equal pivote element then stop 
   ans then if doesnot cross the each element then  exchange the position or p and q
   and then p and q cross to each other then q exchange with pivote element
