/* first let first element as a pivot element 
   and lets two point like p and q 
   p is stay in one step away from pivot element
   if p is greater than  ans equal pivote element then stop
   if q is less than and equal pivote element then stop 
   ans then if doesnot cross the each element then  exchange the position or p and q
   and then p and q cross to each other then q exchange with pivote element


   key:- (there are two pointer like p,q and pv means pivote elements)
   (1)if p>=pv :- stop
   (2)if q<p :-   stop
   (3)if (p<q) swap between (p,g)
   (4)if p cross q then swap(p,pv)
